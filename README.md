# Machine-Learning-Classifiers

This project aims to develop and evaluate two classifiers: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Na√Øve Bayes. 
The dataset used contains candidemia patient data, with 77 features and a binary class outcome.
The focus is on providing practical experience in machine learning algorithm development, covering data preprocessing, model structure design, parameter tuning, and model evaluation.
